## HISTOGRAM EQUALIZATION

Image processing is one of the rapidly growing technologies of our time and it has become an integral part of the engineering and computer science disciplines. Among its many subsets, techniques such as median filter, contrast stretching, histogram equalization, negative image transformation, and power-law transformation are considered to be the most prominent. In this tutorial, we will focus on the histogram equalization.
